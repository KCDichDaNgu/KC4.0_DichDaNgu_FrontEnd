Thank you for choosing the Olympus dictation management system. The Olympus dictation management system gives you the power to manage your dictations, transcriptions and documents seamlessly and to improve the productivity of your daily work. For example, you can automatically send the dictation files or transcribed documents to your assistant or the author via email or FTP. If you're using the speech recognition software, the speech recognition engine works in the background to support your document creation. We hope you enjoy the simple, flexible, reliable and secure solutions from Olympus.
